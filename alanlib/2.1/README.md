# Alan Standard Library v2.1

The files in this folder were downloaded from Yahoo: 

- https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/alan-if/files/ALAN%20Standard%20Library%20v2.1%20files/

These were made avaiable by its author to the [Alan-IF discussion group at Yahoo] as an early access, before they are included in the [downloads area of the Alan website], or on [Bitbucket]. Some of the file that usually ship with the Standard Library are not present here (changelog, license, etc.). 

I've therefore manually added the license file [`COPYING.txt`](./COPYING.txt) found in the Standard Library v2.0, as a safeguard to the author's rights.

As soon as v2.1 of the standard library will be made available for [download on Alan website] and/or [Bitbucket], I'll update the folder contents with the missing files.
